# fetch-niddb.sh — bootstrap the PSP NID database required by `psprecomp analyze`.
#
# WHAT THIS FETCHES
#   data/niddb/ppsspp_niddb.xml — a flat <NID> -> <NAME> map of ~2183 PSP
#   firmware function NIDs (the 4-byte SHA-1-derived identifiers Sony's PRX
#   format uses for imports/exports) to their human-readable names. `analyze`
#   needs it to resolve the binary's import stubs to real SDK function names
#   (e.g. NID 0x... -> sceGeListEnQueue) instead of NID_0xXXXXXXXX fallbacks.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT (not a committed file)
#   The NID names are derived from PPSSPP (GPL-2.0-or-later). This repo is also
#   GPL-2.0-or-later and already attributes PPSSPP, so vendoring would be
#   license-compatible — but the canonical, maintained copy lives upstream in
#   pspdev/psp-ghidra-scripts, so we fetch it from there to stay in sync and
#   avoid carrying a stale duplicate. `data/` is gitignored.
#
# SOURCE / ATTRIBUTION
#   File:    ppsspp_niddb.xml
#   Repo:    https://github.com/pspdev/psp-ghidra-scripts  (NID list derived
#            from PPSSPP source — https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp)
#   License: PPSSPP is GPL-2.0-or-later; the NID->name mappings are factual.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: re-running with the file already present and matching the pinned
# checksum is a no-op. Exits non-zero with a clear message if the source is
# unreachable or the download fails verification.
