/// Every command replies with an ACK header:
///     "OK <len>\n"  followed by exactly <len> payload bytes, or
///     "ERR <reason>\n"  with no payload.
/// Malformed or unknown input always gets an ERR reply, never silence.
///
/// Commands (one per line, human-typeable via nc):
///     I                       -- info: one JSON line as the OK payload
///     R   <hexaddr> <decsize> -- read masked PSP memory (framed)
///     RAW <hexaddr> <decsize> -- legacy v1 read: raw bytes, NO framing
///     W   <hexaddr> <hexbytes>-- write bytes into rdram (masked, bounds-checked)
///     B   <hexmask> <decms>   -- inject button mask for <ms> milliseconds
///     S   <path>              -- screenshot: render thread writes a TGA to
///                                <path>; OK once written, ERR on timeout
